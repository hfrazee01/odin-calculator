# odin-calculator
Finish the Odin Foundations course with a calculator project using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The goal of this project was to apply everything that I learned in the Foundations course of The Odin Project to develop a calculator. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with DOM manipulation, I was able to create a calculator using a combination of event listeners and DOM manipulation.

Regarding the style of the calculator, I attempted to replicate the coloring of the Apple calculator top so that I could test my color matching skills. I was able to have all numbers on the calculator along with a decimal for floating point numbers. I got all the operations to work as well with the added bonuses of display clearing functionality, sign switching, and percentage change. Additionaly, I was able to add key bindings so that the number pad of a keyboard could be used instead of clicking on the buttons.
